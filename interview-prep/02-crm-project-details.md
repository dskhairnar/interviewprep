## Possible Interview Questions (CRM) with Sample Answers

### 1) Why a custom CRM instead of an off-the-shelf tool?
**Answer**: Domain-specific needs—KYC workflows, investment portfolio tracking, SEBI compliance—aren’t covered well by generic CRMs. Custom build offers tighter integration with stock market APIs and tailored compliance checks.

### 2) How is KYC handled end-to-end?
**Answer**: Users upload documents via a secure file upload pipeline (Multer → cloud storage). Metadata is saved in MongoDB with status transitions (pending → verified/rejected). Admins verify documents; expirations trigger alerts. Access to documents is restricted and URLs are short-lived.

### 3) How do you ensure data privacy and compliance?
**Answer**: PII is encrypted at rest; transport secured with TLS. Least-privilege access, audit logs for sensitive operations, and comprehensive data retention policies. Regular security scans and dependency updates.

### 4) How do you model leads → clients conversion?
**Answer**: Leads have a lifecycle status; conversion creates a `Client` entity referencing the original `leadId`, preserving history. Transactions ensure consistency when migrating notes and interactions.

### 5) How do you integrate real-time stock data?
**Answer**: Use provider webhooks/polling to refresh holdings; cache quotes with TTL; decouple ingestion via a queue so the UI remains responsive. Handle provider rate limits via backoff and batching.

### 6) What indexing strategies improved performance most?
**Answer**: Compound indexes on `(assignedManager, status)`, text index on lead notes, and TTL/indexes where applicable for temp data. Use `explain()` to tune slow queries.

### 7) How do you prevent duplicate leads?
**Answer**: Normalize and deduplicate on `(email, phone)` with unique partial indexes; add fuzzy matching for near-duplicates and a manual merge flow.

### 8) How would you scale this system?
**Answer**: Separate services for auth, KYC, and investments; use message queues for document processing; add read replicas for analytics; partition large collections; CDN for static assets.

### 9) Disaster recovery?
**Answer**: Automated backups, cross-region replication, and runbooks for failover. Routine restoration drills to validate backups.

### 10) Security pitfalls avoided?
**Answer**: Avoided storing permanent public URLs for documents; enforced strict MIME/type checks; implemented rate limiting on uploads and verification endpoints.
